# ⚡ NewTab OS — Your Browser’s Personal Command Center

Turn every new tab into a clean, fast, *useful* workspace — not a blank page.  
**NewTab OS** replaces Chrome’s default New Tab with a modular dashboard built for real daily use: quick searches, shortcuts, tasks, notes, focus timer, calculators, and a dedicated **Salary Lab** for offer comparison + in-hand estimation.

> If your browser is where you work, your new tab should work *for you*.

## ✨ Why NewTab OS?

Most “new tab” extensions are either:
- pretty but useless, or
- useful but cluttered.

NewTab OS is designed to be:
- **Instant** — opens like a native new tab should.
- **Practical** — features you actually use daily.
- **Personal** — configurable cards, themes, preferences.
- **Private** — built to keep your data in your browser.

## 🧠 Philosophy

NewTab OS follows a simple product rule:

**A New Tab should be a launchpad.**  
Not a dead-end.

Everything here is built around:
- quick actions
- low friction
- daily usefulness
- clean layout

---

## 🔐 Privacy

NewTab OS is built with a privacy-first approach.

- No ads
- No tracking
- No “account required”
- Your tasks + notes + preferences remain in your browser (local storage)

*(If you later add optional sync, it should stay opt-in.)*
